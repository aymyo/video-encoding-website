The website is live and hosted at: https://video-encoding-course.vercel.app/ 

## Technology

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that uses the [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) library, which allows mdx content to be loaded via `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`. The mdx content is loaded from a local folder, but it could be loaded from a database or anywhere else. It is deployed with the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/). 

The following libraries have been used:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- 

### Run it locally

Download the repository, and install the dependencies ``npm install``. Afterward, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the project.
