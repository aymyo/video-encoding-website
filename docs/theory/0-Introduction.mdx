## About this site

This website hosts all the information related to the course 'Video Encoding Systems' taught at the
[University Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) in Barcelona, as part of its Engineering Audiovisual
Systems degree.

It was developed to make it more comfortable for both students and teachers to manage, modify and
share the course information. If you see any mistake, typo, or you found information that could
complement what is showcased on this site, feel free to make a _pull request_ with your proposal
using the button at the bottom of the pages.

Additionally, we're making the knowledge open to anyone interested in it. If you are not enrolled in
the course, you are free to roam around the site and learn as much as you want! But of course, don't
expect any certificate or evaluation.

## Expected learnings

After completing this course and assimilating everything that has to offer, you should be able to

- Apply knowledge of video coding systems to solve problems that may arise in engineering.

- Identify and model complex systems. Make qualitative analyzes and approximations, establishing the
  uncertainty of the results. Raise hypotheses and experimental methods to validate them. Identify
  key components and set commitments and priorities.

- Apply the skills acquired to carry out tasks autonomously. Identify the need for lifelong learning
  and develop your strategy for doing so.

## Contents

- T1: JPEG i JPEG2000
- T2: MPEG i MPEG2
- T3: MPEG4, h264 & Broadcasting standards
- T4: Future in codecs
- T5: Streaming masterclass

These contents are available on this website and in the Aula Global in the University website.
Additionally, the teacher of this course [Javi Brines](/about), has recorded some video lessons to
accompany the written theory, which are also available on this site.

## Prerequisites

This course is expected to be completed in the 4rth year of an engineering degree, so it would be
ideal to learn beforehand all the knowledge that that implies. Nevertheless, the main previous
information needed is:

- Basics in programming (ideally Python)
- Basics in signal processing
- TO DO

## Technical requirements

There are some requirements to be able to follow the course:

1. Having a Debian-link Linux distribution (Ubuntu recommended). You can either install it natively
   or use a virtual machine, but the first approach is recommended, since some of the last exercises
   require a considerable amount of processing speed, and would be too slow in a virtual machine.

   It is also possible to use the Mackintosh terminal.

2. Install an IDE for Python. Some examples are PyCharm or Atom. Search for _linters_ for your
   preferred IDE and apply the PEP-8 conventions.

3. If you are a student at UPF: Have a Github account. Be sure to include your full name in the
   profile. Also, it is preferable to use your laptops instead of the university ones, to avoid
   issues with permits.

## Teaching Methods

The organization of this subject is based on the interaction of the theory, seminars, and practices.

During the theory sessions, all the concepts towards video encoding and decoding will be introduced.
The theory block will be worked during the seminars and the practices, in a hands-on way and with
software programming. Students will be able to understand better the encoding and they will be able
to create their encoding systems, as well as to evaluate the results. Students will work in groups
and individually.

## Evaluation

This section only addresses students enrolled in the university course.

The evaluation in this part of the subject is determined by:

- 50% Theory (Final exam)
- 50% Labs (That we will work on both on seminars and practice sessions)

This course is joined together with the 'Audio Encoding Systems' course. To be able to pass, a
minimum of 6 out of 10 is needed in each of the blocks of both subjects. To the theory blocks, an
exam will be realized together in December, which will be scored out of 10 points, which will divide
into 5 points for the audio block and 5 points for the video one.

If a student fails the ordinary call, there will be an extraordinary call in July to recover the
subject. In the subject recovery, the student will have an exam where all 4 blocks of the subject
will be evaluated. Lecturers reserve the right to offer the student a research project as a
substitution for the exam. In that case, the student won’t be able to achieve a higher mark of 6 out
of 10, with now a 5 being the mínimum required to pass. If the final mark is higher than 6 out of
10, it will be truncated to 6.

With that being said, let's start!
