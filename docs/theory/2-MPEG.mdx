## Basic concepts: aspect ratio and video

Let's start this second theory lesson by explaining another couple basic concept about images (and videos):

The **aspect ratio** describtes the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image, video or pixel. If we apply it to screens, we call it Display Aspect Ratio (DAR). It is defined as two numbers divided by a semicolon, for example:

The concept can also be used for píxels, so the PAR will describe the relationship between height and width or the shape of the píxel.

Before we explore the video formats, let's agree on what a **video** is. We can define a video as a succesion of _n_ frames in time (which we can see as another dimension). This _n_ is the framerate ot frames per second (fps).

Furthermore we define **bitrate** as the number of bits per second needed to show a video. ``bitRate = width * height * bitDepth * FPS``. For example, if we have a video with 30fps, 24 bits/pixel and a 480x240 resolution, we will need 82944000 bits per second, or 82.944 Mbps (30 * 480 * 240 * 24) if we dont employ any kind of compression.

When the bitrate is nearly constant, we call it CBR (constant bit rate). On the other hand, if its variable, VBR (variable bit rate).

The are also techniques to double the precieved framerate without consuming extra bandwith. The first one used was _interlaced video_, which sent half of the screen in one frame, and the other half in the other frame skipping every other line. Nowadays _progressive scan video_ is used, which displays, stores or transmits moving images drawing all the lines of each frame in sequence.
