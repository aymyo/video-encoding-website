Before learning about video encoding, it is relevant to have some previous terminology and concepts
assimilated. Most of them you might already know, but a refresh never hurts!

## Important concepts

The **pixel** (picture element) represents the intensity of a given color, and it's usually a
numeric value.

- For example: Red Pixel: 0 of green + 0 of blue + maximum of red
- Pink Pixel: 192 of green + 203 of blue + 255 of red. 

In the following image you can see how the values from the three channels are added to form the pixel color:

But there's other ways to encode a color image. For example, we can use and indexed palette where we will only need a single byte to represent each pixel, instead of the 3 needed when using the RGB model. In this kind of model, we can use a 2D matrix instead of a 3D one to represent color, saving memory but limiting our color options.
