Before learning about video encoding, it is relevant to have some previous terminology and concepts
assimilated. Most of them you might already know, but a refresh never hurts!

## Important concepts

The **pixel** (picture element) represents the intensity of a given color, and it's usually a
numeric value.

- For example: Red Pixel: 0 of green + 0 of blue + maximum of red
- Pink Pixel: 192 of green + 203 of blue + 255 of red.
