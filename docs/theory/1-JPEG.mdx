Before learning about video encoding, it is relevant to have some previous terminology and concepts
assimilated. Most of them you might already know, but a refresh never hurts! A video is by definition a succesion of images, so we will start with underdestanding the JPEG image format.

## Basic concepts

The **pixel** (picture element) represents the intensity of a given color, and it's usually a
numeric value. For example: 

- Red Pixel = 0 of green + 0 of blue + maximum of red
- Pink Pixel: 192 of green + 203 of blue + 255 of red. 

We make use of a three dimensional space where the intensity of each of the RGB colors is added to display our desired one.

There's other ways to encode a color image. For example, we can use and indexed palette where we will only need a single byte to represent each pixel, instead of the 3 needed when using the RGB model. In this kind of model, we can use a 2D matrix instead of a 3D one to represent color, saving memory but limiting our color options. For the JPEG, we will only consider the first method.

Another basic concept is **resolution**, which is the number of pixels in  a single dimension.

## JPEG

As every other coding standard, is created by a board of experts which try to agree on a normalized way. In this case, the **Joint Photographic Experts Group**. The ISO norm was created in 1983. It is a lossy compression method (which means we are losing information when compressing) and supports true color (24 bits, or 16777216 different colors).

The following is the encoding / decoding diagrams of the JPEG compression:

Since it's a lossy method, the reconstructed image will not be equal to the original.

To understand better the JPEG, let's think about how the human eye works: we recognize objects equally well regardless of the image size, and that recognition doesn't depend on image size. Based on this concepts, the JPEG achieves a considerable compression of data, making it extremely used in computing and the Internet.

In the previous comparison, we can see the comparison between an uncompressed image and one compressed with JPEG. The image goes from 83 to 10 kilobytes, which is about 1/8 of compression, mataining enough information so that the human eye understands the image.
